FlindersDSpace-importERA
========================

Release Notes
-------------

v1.0
----

Compatible with DSpace 3.1.

Initial version.  Has been used in a production environment for loading
ERA 2012 metadata into DSpace.

High level features:
- Phase 1 - Ingest new items
- Phase 2 - Map items to multiple collections
- Phase 3 - Update old items with new field values

v1.1
----

Compatible with DSpace 3.1.

Added tool utils/map_if_bitstream_wrap.sh to map any items with a
bitstream attached from a draft/initial ERA collection to a "final"
ERA collection (where final means that all items within have a
bitstream attached)

v1.2
----

Compatible with DSpace 3.1.

Added tool utils/get_item_info.sh

Added tool utils/map_if_fulltext_wrap.sh. Similar to map_if_bitstream_wrap.sh
but the objective is to map any items (in any collection) containing
non-embargoed full-text into a full-text collection. The intent is that
OAI-PMH harvesters can choose to harvest this collection (instead of the
whole of DSpace) in order to only obtain items with full-text. This is
because metadata-only items can be confusing to users. The following
features are included.
- Updates the last_modified field when we map an item with full-text so
  that incremental OAI-PMH behaves properly for the "full-text collection"
  set (particularly for items where an embargo has been lifted).
- Has a MAX_ITEMS_TO_PROCESS parameter.
- Has a IS_DRY_RUN feature.
