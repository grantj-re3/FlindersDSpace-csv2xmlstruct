1. APPLICATION ENVIRONMENT

- ruby 1.8.7 (2011-06-30 patchlevel 352) [x86_64-linux]
- GNU bash, version 4.1.2(1)-release (x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu)
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.5 (Santiago)
- 2.6.32-279.19.1.el6.x86_64 #1 SMP Sat Nov 24 14:35:28 EST 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
- DSpace 3.x

If you cannot install the above ruby version to your Unix/Linux
operating system from source or via your normal package management 
system, consider using Ruby Version Manager at https://rvm.io.

Since it is not a requirement that csv2xmlstruct.rb and
csv2xmlstruct_wrap.sh be run on the same host where DSpace is running,
I imagine someone may wish to run it on a Microsoft Windows platform.

Although this software has not been designed to run under the Microsoft
Windows operating system, it may be feasible under 2 scenarios.
 - Install Cygwin (see http://www.cygwin.com) then run ruby and bash scripts
   under that environment.
 - Install Ruby 1.8.7 (I understand pik at https://github.com/vertiginous/pik
   may be useful to install a particular version) then if required, rewrite
   shell scripts in some Windows language (eg. as .BAT scripts)


2. INSTALLATION


2.1 WARNING

- It is important to understand what the "dspace structure-builder" and
  "dspace community-filiator" commands do before running them.
  * Read the DSpace 3.x manual regarding the above commands.
  * Experiment on a DSpace test server before running on a production
    server.


2.2 ASSUMPTIONS

- That you have a basic understanding of Linux/Unix, Ruby and bash (or sh or
  ksh) shell scripts.
- That you are using a Linux, Unix or Unix-like environment similar to that
  described under APPLICATION ENVIRONMENT.
- You have DSpace installed as given under APPLICATION ENVIRONMENT.
- You do *not* need to run this application on the same host as the DSpace
  server, but it is probably more convenient if you do.


2.3 INSTRUCTIONS

- Download from github
- Checkout latest version/tag if applicable
- Update config for your site, in particular: ...
- Run bin/csv2xmlstruct_wrap.sh to create the XML community/collection
  file structure.
- If required, copy the file structure to a DSpace test environment.
- Run the "dspace structure-builder" script
- If required, run the "dspace community-filiator" script


3. EXAMPLES


3.1 SAMPLE INSTALLATION AND TEST RUN

The purpose of this sample is to:
- show how to install and configure this application
- show how to build the resulting structure in DSpace


Scenario:

- You have a test environment to experiment with this app.
- You have created a DSpace community (top-level or not) named say
  "ERA Publications" (eg. handle 123456789/0)
- You are happy with the constant declarations at the top of files:
  * bin/csv2xmlstruct.rb
  * lib/collection.rb
  * lib/community.rb
- This application to be installed in $HOME/opt/csv2xmlstruct of an
  unprivileged user.


Instructions:

mkdir ~/opt
git clone https://github.com/grantj-re3/FlindersDSpace-csv2xmlstruct.git ~/opt/csv2xmlstruct
cd ~/opt/csv2xmlstruct

# If you want a particular version
git tag # List tagged releases
git checkout ... # Checkout the desired release

# Read files INSTALL LICENSE README*


# Update config for your site, ie. the constant declarations at the top of files:
  * bin/csv2xmlstruct.rb
  * lib/collection.rb
  * lib/community.rb


# Run the program as described in the "Example usage" section in README.md.

# Celebrate!
